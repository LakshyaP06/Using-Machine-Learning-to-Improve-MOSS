# Using-Machine-Learning-to-Improve-MOSS
This script was created using Juypter Notebook.
The rise of large language models (LLMs) has made it more difficult to detect plagiarism, which makes cheating prevention even more challenging for academic institutions to maintain academic integrity. Despite being an effective tool for identifying exact code matches, MOSS is not sensitive enough to pick up on LLM-based complex manipulations or "lightly edited" code. The objective of this code is to explore how machine learning can be integrated into a MOSS parser to improve accuracy of plagiarised AI-generated code in student submissions, by studying trends in plagiarism detection and analysing different techniques that can be employed to evade them to develop an efficient way of detecting and preventing plagiarism through a combination of enhanced detection algorithms, machine learning and human oversight. The research will introduce better strategies for preserving academic integrity against multiple challenges such as updated detection algorithms, artificial intelligence and oversight by humans themselves. The developed model combines TF-IDF vectorisation with AST-based features to achieve a high average accuracy of 92.78%, showing effectiveness in differentiating between AI-generated code and human-written code, while underscoring the potential of machine learning to enhance academic integrity through improved detection mechanisms.
